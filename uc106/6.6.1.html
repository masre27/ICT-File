<p class="heading"> Printer</p>



<dfn class="note">A computer printer is a computer peripheral device that produces a hard copy (permanent human-readable text and/or graphics, usually on paper) from data stored in a computer connected to it A printer is used to print anything that you want, like pictures or documents or data. Printers are awesome devices that plug in where there is a USB slot, from there you can click print and the document is sent to the port where you document is printed onto a piece of paper. You can print images, documents, cards, etc.</dfn>
     <p class="note">As we have already seen in the unit before, it is very easy to install new hardware, such as printers, since the majority use Plug&Play technology. This allows the operating system to recognize the new printer by simply plugging it in.  </p>

<p class "note">Nevertheless, in some cases we may need to do the process manually. When we plug a printer into our computer it is necessary to install the appropriate drivers so that our computer will recognize it.
Next we will learn to install a printer manually and to customize it to our needs.</p>
