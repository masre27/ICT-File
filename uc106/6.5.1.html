<p class="heading"> Knowing the types of files </p>



   
     <p class="note"> To know the type of files registered in the computer and know with which program they open with, simply select the option Folder options... from the Tools menu. </p>

<p class="heading">Select the tab File types </p>
     <p class="note">On the window that appears we have all of the types of files that our computer can open. If we select any of them, the details of the program with which it opens will appear.
If you want to add a new type of File or change the program with which we open any of them click here. 
This can be useful, for example to change the program that opens the text documents with a TXT. extension that are normally opened with the Notepad, but it can be more useful to have them open with Microsoft Word or WordPad.   </p>
<p class="heading"> Searching </p>
<p class "note"> Today's computers allow us to store a great deal of information. Because of this, we suggest you keep your information well-classified and organized so that finding it is an easy process.</p>
<p class "note"> Despite having the information well-clasified, it can happen that sometimes we cannot find a file or folder. When this occurs, we can resort to the Search function provided by Windows to locate the file or folder quickly.</p>
<p class "note">The search provided by Windows XP also allows us to search for hardware, a network, people in the directory, Internet pages, etc. </p>
