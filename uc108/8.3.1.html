<font size="5" style="font-size: 17pt"><u><b>How to Be an Effective
Team Member</b></u></font>?<br/>
<br/>
Working on teams can be
rewarding, but at times it can be difficult and downright
frustrating. If there are poor communicators on your team, you may
often feel left in the dark, confused or misunderstood. To create a
successful team, effective communication methods are necessary for
both team members and leaders. Even though some people understand
their communication skills need improving, many aren't certain how to
improve them. So, in the following article, we've outlined how to
avoid some common team blunders as well as some helpful advice on how
to be a better teammate or leader overall. Go… team</p>

Keys to Motivating Your Team </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
have seen many speakers, read many articles and heard many ideas on
how best to motivate team members. There are so many opinions and
ideas with different steps and methodologies that it is easy to lose
focus on what is important, the team member! Unfortunately, there is
no &quot;one way fits all&quot; approach to motivating team members.
But there are the six key factors you need to take into account if
you want your efforts to have an impact.</font></font></p>
<ol>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Make
	it personal<br/>
<br/>
</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A
	cookie-cutter approach to rewarding or motivating your team will not
	work. Every one of your team members has different dreams, goals and
	reasons for coming to work. For some, a handwritten note from the
	CEO will mean the world, for others only cash will do. Get to know
	your team. Find out what makes them tick. What hobbies do they have?
	What does their family need? What can you get for them that they
	would love but can't get themselves?&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Money is not
	always the answer. In fact, it is frequently not the best motivator.
	A lot gets taken in tax, it just becomes money in their bank account
	and nothing special. There also comes a time when people have enough
	money. Find out what hits their hot buttons and then hit
	it!!&nbsp;(Repeatedly if you can and if they deserve it!)</font></font></p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Do
	it in the right location<br/>
<br/>
</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Some
	people love the spotlight. Nothing would make them feel better than
	to be up on stage in front of the entire company receiving rapturous
	applause for a job well done. For other people, this would be their
	idea of hell. They just need a little bit of acknowledgement from
	one or two of &quot;the right&quot; people and that is all they
	need. Again, you need to know the personality of your team member to
	acknowledge them in the right location.</font></font></p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Make
	it worthwhile<br/>
<br/>
</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If
	the effort to motivate is not worthwhile, you will find you have in
	fact DE-motivated them. When I started in the IT industry, I had
	worked hundreds of hours overtime on a particular long-term project,
	and then got a bonus that worked out to be 2 cents an hour. The
	bonuses were the joke of the office. If they had given us an extra 3
	days of annual leave it would have cost them the same and we would
	have been thrilled. One of my coaching clients said, &quot;I can't
	bear the thought of getting another movie ticket for doing a good
	job. It is such a waste.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the &quot;token
	gesture&quot;, while well-meaning and with good intent, does more
	harm than good. Make sure that what you are doing is worthwhile for
	the team member and not just going through the motions.</font></font></p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Link

<br/>
</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Ultimately
	you are motivating your team to get them to repeat certain
	behaviours. So if you are having a conversation with them and the
	CEO about what a great job they have done, the sales results they
	have generated or the completion of a project, make sure they
	associate the conversation or reward with the behaviour. It is very
	much like Pavlov's dogs. You want the behaviour related to the
	reward so that they repeat the behaviour.</font></font></p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Make
	it with pride<br/>
<br/>
</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">For
	many people, receiving an acknowledgement is about the emotion of
	the situation and not any physical reward. Many managers have handed
	out rewards, bonuses and even pay rises, like Santa throwing lollies
	to crowds of children. &quot;Here's one for you and one for you and
	one for you...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Make it special. Make it really
	count for your team. They need to feel loved and appreciated and
	have pride in their accomplishment.</font></font></p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Do
	it<br/>
<br/>
</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Motivate
	your team however you can. Don't worry if you get it wrong. For many
	people the fact that you are trying something is enough. But do
	something. Do not believe for a moment that the salary or wage is
	enough. You need to do something extra to keep them fired-up and
	with a sense of loyalty and belonging.<br/>
<br/>
Typically, saying
	&quot;Thank You&quot; and acknowledging their efforts and results
	will make a huge difference. So even if you are restricted
	financially and can't do anything special for the team, you can at
	least acknowledge their work and what it means to you and the
	company's overall results. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
reality is that you cannot motivate anyone on your team. Motivation
is up to them. It is something that only the individual can do. All
you can do is create the circumstances in which they are most likely
to remain positive and driven to get the results you are after. Get
to know your team. Find out what they like and what energizes them,
as individuals and as a team.</font></font></p>
<h1 class="western"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Ten
Qualities of an Effective Team Player</font></h1>
<h2 class="western">Demonstrates reliability</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">You can count on a reliable team
member who gets work done and does his fair share to work hard and
meet commitments. He or she follows through on assignments.
Consistency is key. You can count on him or her to deliver good
performance all the time, not just some of the time.</font></p>
<h2 class="western">Communicates constructively</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Teams need people who speak up
and express their thoughts and ideas clearly, directly, honestly, and
with respect for others and for the work of the team. That's what it
means to communicate constructively. Such a team member does not shy
away from making a point but makes it in the best way possible — in
a positive, confident, and respectful manner.</font></p>
<h2 class="western">Listens actively</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Good listeners are essential for
teams to function effectively. Teams need team players who can
absorb, understand, and consider ideas and points of view from other
people without debating and arguing every point. Such a team member
also can receive criticism without reacting defensively. Most
important, for effective communication and problem solving, team
members need the discipline to listen first and speak second so that
meaningful dialogue results.</font></p>
<h2 class="western">Functions as an active participant</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Good team players are active
participants. They come prepared for team meetings and listen and
speak up in discussions. They're fully engaged in the work of the
team and do not sit passively on the sidelines.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Team members who function as
active participants take the initiative to help make things happen,
and they volunteer for assignments. Their whole approach is can-do:
&quot;What contribution can <i>I</i> make to help the team achieve
success?&quot;</font></p>
<h2 class="western">Shares openly and willingly</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Good team players share. They're
willing to share information, knowledge, and experience. They take
the initiative to keep other team members informed.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Much of the communication within
teams takes place informally. Beyond discussion at organized
meetings, team members need to feel comfortable talking with one
another and passing along important news and information day-to-day.
Good team players are active in this informal sharing. They keep
other team members in the loop with information and expertise that
helps get the job done and prevents surprises.</font></p>
<h2 class="western">Cooperates and pitches in to help</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Cooperation is the act of working
<i>with </i>others and acting together to accomplish a job. Effective
team players work this way by second nature. Good team players,
despite differences they may have with other team members concerning
style and perspective, figure out ways to work together to solve
problems and get work done. They respond to requests for assistance
and take the initiative to offer help.</font></p>
<h2 class="western">Exhibits flexibility</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Teams often deal with changing
conditions — and often create changes themselves. Good team players
roll with the punches; they adapt to ever-changing situations. They
don't complain or get stressed out because something new is being
tried or some new direction is being set.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">In addition, a flexible team
member can consider different points of views and compromise when
needed. He or she doesn't hold rigidly to a point of view and argue
it to death, especially when the team needs to move forward to make a
decision or get something done. Strong team players are firm in their
thoughts yet open to what others have to offer — flexibility at its
best.</font></p>
<h2 class="western">Shows commitment to the team</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Strong team players care about
their work, the team, and the team's work. They show up every day
with this care and commitment up front. They want to give a good
effort, and they want other team members to do the same.</font></p>
<h2 class="western">Works as a problem-solver</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Teams, of course, deal with
problems. Sometimes, it appears, that's the whole reason why a team
is created — to address problems. Good team players are willing to
deal with all kinds of problems in a solutions-oriented manner.
They're problem-solvers, not problem-dwellers, problem-blamers, or
problem-avoiders. They don't simply rehash a problem the way
problem-dwellers do. They don't look for others to fault, as the
blamers do. And they don't put off dealing with issues, the way
avoiders do.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Team players get problems out in
the open for discussion and then collaborate with others to find
solutions and form action plans.</font></p>
<h2 class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><font size="5" style="font-size: 17pt">Treats
others in a respectful and supportive manner</font></h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Team players treat fellow team
members with courtesy and consideration — not just some of the time
but consistently. In addition, they show understanding and the
appropriate support of other team members to help get the job done.
They don't place conditions on when they'll provide assistance, when
they'll choose to listen, and when they'll share information. Good
team players also have a sense of humor and know how to have fun (and
all teams can use a bit of both), but they don't have fun at someone
else's expense. Quite simply, effective team players deal with other
people in a professional manner.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Team players who show commitment
don't come in any particular style or personality. They don't need to
be rah-rah, cheerleader types. In fact, they may even be soft-spoken,
but they aren't passive. They care about what the team is doing and
they contribute to its success — without needing a push.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Team players with commitment look
beyond their own piece of the work and care about the team's overall
work. In the end, their commitment is about winning — not in the
sports sense of beating your opponent but about seeing the team
succeed and knowing they have contributed to this success. Winning as
a team is one of the great motivators of employee performance. Good
team players have and show this motivation.</font></p>
