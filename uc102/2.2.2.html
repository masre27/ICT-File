<ul class="defnpoints">
    <li>quiet periods (for example, during holiday periods) </li>
    <li>before or after normal office hours </li>
    <li> while the client/user is out of the office</li>
    <li> when the client will not be needing their computer</li>

</ul>

You can check your manuals or documented procedures on how much time it would take to install specific software for a specific hardware.  You can also check the web on how much time your software installation would take given your hardware.   </p>
