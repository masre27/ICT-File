<p class="heading"> Minimal disruption to the client</p>

<dfn class="defn"><b>One of the most important considerations when installing a new hardware peripheral is to try and install the device with the least amount of disruption to the client. A client may not be very happy if you install a piece of hardware equipment while they are creating an urgent report. It is important to schedule installation times that are:</b></dfn>
<ul class="steps">
    <li>also suitable to the client’s or computer user’s schedules </li>
    <li> sufficient length to install and thoroughly test the hardware device.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this, make sure that you are aware of:</p>
<ul class="defnpoints">
    <li>common organizational procedures that regularly need to be performed on the computer (for example, end of month processing or weekly backups) and plan installations outside these periods </li>
    <li>current projects, deadlines and schedules of the client/user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Installations should be scheduled for times such as:</p>
<ul class="defnpoints">
    <li>quiet periods (for example, during holiday periods) </li>
    <li>before or after normal office hours </li>
    <li> while the client/user is out of the office</li>
    <li> when the client will not be needing their computer.</li>
</ul>
     <p class="note"> It can be difficult to work out how long it will take to install a peripheral device. It will vary according to the type of device, current operating system, problems requiring troubleshooting and the experience of the installer. If you will be regularly performing installations, keeping a log of installations — noting the time required and problems experienced — could help to estimate the time spent on future installations. </p>
     <p class="note">  Once you have arranged a suitable time, make sure you adhere to it or give advanced notice if you will be delayed. Remember that clients may have scheduled their daily workload around the installation.</p>
     <p class="note">  Also consider the timeframe expected by client when installing new hardware. If you work for a busy organization it may be necessary to work out a daily to-do list. Order tasks with priority given to installations that perform critical functions or have been waiting to be done for the longest amount of time. </p>
