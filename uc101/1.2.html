<p class="heading">Confirm Client Requirements</p>

<p class="heading"> System development life cycle</p>



<dfn  class="defn"> To determine appropriate hardware peripheral devices needed within an organization, it is important to clearly understand what your client needs. Often clients don’t have a clear idea of what they want until they have been presented with a series of options. Working out clients’ needs requires careful planning and organisation.
</dfn>
     <p class="note"> The system development life cycle is a methodology that computer consultants often follow to help them properly investigate the client’s information technology needs. The first three stages of the system development life cycle are: </p>

<ul class="defnpoints">
    <li>planning </li>
    <li>analysing </li>
    <li> designing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="heading"> Planning </p>

     <p class="note">  This stage involves identifying the client’s current technology and taking into account any limitations. During the planning phase it is necessary to find out information including:</p>
<ul class="defnpoints">
    <li>system specifications </li>
    <li> connections available</li>
    <li> budget constraints</li>
    <li> available timeframe</li>
    <li> availability of physical space.</li>
</ul>
     <p class="note"> A feasibility study can be performed to provide a preliminary report to the client about benefits, costs and impact to the organisation. Additionally, a project request form allows a client to document their initial request. </p>

<p class="heading">System specifications  </p>

     <p class="note"> It is important to find out the specifications of the computer system you are planning to connect the peripheral device to. Many newer types of peripheral devices require a specific amount of memory, CPU speed, hard disk space, and may only be compatible with certain operating systems.  </p>
     <p class="note"> <b>You also need to be aware of the peripheral’s system requirements. The manual for the peripheral device as well as the manufacturer’s website will help you determine the minimum system specifications. 
</b> </p>

<p class="heading"> Computer peripherals requirement considerations </p>

     <p class="note">Desktop hardware, such as a desktop computer itself, is the most common type of IT hardware purchased by a small business. The cost of hardware depends on its specification, which in turn is determined by some key components. When you buy desktop hardware, you will need to decide what the specification of these key components should be.  </p>
        <p class="note"> The processor is the driver of the computer. Processors are usually differentiated by speed, measured in gigahertz (GHz). The higher the GHz, the faster the computer will run. You should buy the fastest processor you can afford, but a 3 GHz processor will normally be enough for most business functions, e.g. word processing and spreadsheets, together with some multimedia. </p>
   
     <p class="note">  Memory is used by the processor to run programs. Generally, the more random access memory (RAM) you have, the better your computer will run when using several programs at once. Your computer should have enough memory to make the most of the processor speed. For a 3 GHz processor, for example, you should have around 2-3 gigabytes (GB) of RAM.</p>
     <p class="note"> The hard disk is used to store the data you create in your business, as well as the programs you use. Its capacity is much greater than the RAM. An office computer with a 3 GHz processor should have at least 200 GB of hard disk space, but if you intend to use a single desktop PC as the main storage location for all your business data, you will need at least 500 GB. </p>
     <p class="note"> External plug-ins, such as rewritable DVD, DVD-Read Only Memory (ROM), or CD-RW (rewritable) drives can be used to supplement your computer's memory. </p>
     <p class="note"> 		The monitor is the computer's display screen. Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) or flat screen monitors offer reduced bulk and lower power consumption, relative to cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors. Monitors are normally measured diagonally in inches - typically 19, 22 or 24. Larger or wide-screen monitors allow you to compare two documents on-screen. Many monitors have an aspect ratio - the proportion of image width to height - of 16:10, although screens with a 16:9 ratio are becoming more widely available and offer higher resolution. </p>
    <p class="heading"> Display adapter </p>
     <p class="note"> Software requiring a better than average computer graphics display, like graphics editors and high-end games, often define high-end display adapters in the system requirements. </p>
     <p class="heading"> Software requirements </p>
          <p class="note"> Software Requirements deal with defining software resource requirements and pre-requisites that need to be installed on a computer to provide optimal functioning of an application. These requirements or pre-requisites are generally not included in the software installation package and need to be installed separately before the software is installed. </p>
     <p class="heading">1.  Platform </p>
     <p class="note"> In computing, a platform describes some sort of framework, either in hardware or software, which allows software to run. Typical platforms include a computer's architecture, operating system, or programming languages and their run time libraries. </p>
          <p class="note"> Operating system is one of the first requirements mentioned when defining system requirements (software). Software may not be compatible with different versions of same line of operating systems, although some measure of backward compatibility is often maintained. For example, most software designed for Microsoft Windows XP does not run on Microsoft Windows 98, although the converse is not always true. Similarly, software designed using newer features of Linux Kernel v2.6 generally does not run or compile properly (or at all) on Linux distributions using Kernel v2.2 or v2.4. </p>
     <p class="heading"> 2.  APIs and drivers</p>
     
     <p class="note"> Software making extensive use of special hardware devices, like high-end display adapters, needs special API or newer device drivers. A good example is DirectX, which is a collection of APIs for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming, on Microsoft platforms. </p>
     
<p class="heading"> 3.  Web browser</p>

     <p class="note">Most web applications and software depending heavily on Internet technologies make use of the default browser installed on system. Microsoft Internet Explorer is a frequent choice of software running on Microsoft Windows, which makes use of ActiveX controls, despite their vulnerabilities.  </p>
  <p class="heading">Other requirements </p>
       <p class="note"> ome software also has other requirements for proper performance. Internet connection (type and speed) and resolution of the display screen are notable examples.
Examples
Following are a few examples of system requirement definitions for popular PC games and trend of ever increasing resource needs:

As a cost-saving consideration, for a small enterprise, getting the exact client specifications would be a good consideration but for a big enterprise, getting the high end hardware would be of great choice.  

Considering the future hardware trend would also be a deciding factor.  If the price of a specific peripheral remains the same for a long period of time, you could consider buying a high end one since over time the price remains the same while you get a higher hardware performance.   Otherwise, choose a medium range peripherals or just exactly what your organization need since for a short period of time the price lowers so you could have an opportunity of upgrading it to a high end one in the future at a low cost.    

Another factor is what operating system are you going to use?  Below are the hardware requirements for installing Windows XP and Windows 7:  
 </p>
  <p class="heading"> Hardware Requirements for Windows 7 system </p>
  <p>If you want to run Windows 7 on your PC, here's what it takes:</p>
  <ul class="defnpoints">
    <li>1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor </li>
    <li> 1 gigabyte (GB) RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit)</li>
    <li> 16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit)</li>
    <li>DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver </li>
</ul>
<p class="heading"> Hardware Requirements for Windows XP Home Edition and Windows XP Professional.</p>
       <p class="note">  These are the minimum requirements for basic functionality. Actual requirements vary, depending on the system configuration and the programs and features that you choose to install. If you are installing Windows XP over a network, you may need additional available hard-disk space.</p>
  <p class="heading"> The minimum hardware requirements for Windows XP Home Edition are:</p>
  <ul class="defnpoints">
    <li>Pentium 233-megahertz (MHz) processor or faster (300 MHz is recommended) </li>
    <li> At least 64 megabytes (MB) of RAM (128 MB is recommended)</li>
    <li>At least 1.5 gigabytes (GB) of available space on the hard disk</li>
    <li> CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive</li>
    <li> Keyboard and a Microsoft Mouse or some other compatible pointing device</li>
    <li>Video adapter and monitor with Super VGA (800 x 600)or higher resolution </li>
    <li> Sound card</li>
    <li> Speakers or headphones</li>

</ul>
       <p class="note">  		After you have determine your organization needs, you can now start documenting your hardware needs, to help you decide on the specifications, canvassing would be a great idea.  There were several sites in the net where you can browse and compare the price of the different medium range to high end computer peripherals.  One by one you can list down the hardware specs for your client.  The list below will help you in documenting your chosen hardware:</p>
  <ul class="defnpoints">
    <li> Processor	</li>
    <li> RAM or Memory	</li>
    <li>	Hard Disk size </li>
    <li>Video Card </li>
    <li>Lan Card	 </li>
    <li> DVD drive</li>
    <li> Sound Card</li>
    <li> Mouse	</li>
    <li> Keyboard	</li>
    <li> Monitor	</li>
</ul>
       <p class="note"> 	One deciding factor to consider in buying computer peripherals is the warranty and after sales support service.  A cheaper price would vary greatly on the performance, durability and warranty.  Mostly, the cheaper it gets, the less durable and less warranty you could expect.  Oftentimes, the good warranty and after sales service they provide, the better the quality of the products they have.  Do not risk buying the cheaper one if you’re not sure of the quality.

	After you have finalized your hardware specifications, you can now forward it to the right person for budget considerations and finally for procurement.  </p>
	<p class="heading"> Budget constraints</p>
       <p class="note"> While planning the connection of hardware peripheral devices, it is important to be aware of the client’s available budget. A client needs to determine whether the benefits that will be gained from the peripheral device justify the financial outlay. Factors including the organisation’s size, the necessity of the peripheral device to the organisation, number of people requiring the device, will all contribute to the organisation’s allocation of a budget. Costs will sometimes prohibit an organisation from proceeding with the purchase of equipment. 
Another cost to consider is ongoing maintenance. A laser printer, for example, may initially be more expensive to purchase than an inkjet printer. However when you consider that some inkjet cartridges can cost nearly as much as an inkjet printer, it may be more practical to choose a laser printer, where toner costs are more reasonable. </p>
  <p class="heading">Available timeframe</p>
       <p class="note">The time available to complete a task also needs to be considered when identifying client requirements. If, for example, a peripheral device is needed urgently, it will be necessary to quickly find out which suppliers can immediately provide the peripheral equipment.   </p>
  <p class="heading">Physical space restrictions </p>
       <p class="note"> Before considering acquiring any peripheral device, planning needs to be done to work out where and how the peripheral will reside. The following questions need to be considered:
What physical space is available to accommodate the device? 
Are power points in a near proximity if the device needs them? 
If a peripheral does not have access to a suitable power source, problems may occur including the overloading of power boards and power leads causing dangerous obstructions to users of the equipment.
Will the installation of the device mean other equipment needs to be relocated?
Could the device cause disruption or impact on the safety of users? </p>
<p class="heading">Feasibility study </p>
     <p class="note"> A feasibility study can be carried out to show the client benefits, approximate costs of the new equipment and the impact on the organisation. Several hardware devices can also be recommended to the client. The aim of the feasibility study is to recognise the best solution under the circumstances by identifying the effects of this solution on the organisation.
After undertaking a feasibility study, it may be discovered that a simple solution is possible. Take the example of an organisation that would like to update their monitors so that they can have better screen resolution. Changing the monitors’ internal settings could be a very simple solution to obtain an improved resolution.
A feasibility study can also reveal that a client’s peripheral requirements are not achievable. The requirements may exceed budget, or the requested peripheral devices may not be compatible with the current computer system. The results of a feasibility study can determine whether or not an organisation proceeds with the purchase and installation of the peripheral devices.  </p>
<p class="heading"> Project request form</p>
     <p class="note">  An initial request for hardware peripheral devices can be documented using a project request form. This form documents information from both the client and the computer consultant in order to document preliminary requirements. 
Typical information requested on a project request form includes: </p>
<ul class="defnpoints">
    <li> project title</li>
    <li>date received </li>
    <li> completion date</li>
    <li>project number </li>
    <li>description of problem </li>
    <li> objectives</li>
    <li> anticipated benefits</li>
    <li> person requesting</li>
    <li> constraints.</li>
</ul>
