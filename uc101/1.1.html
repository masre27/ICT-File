 <p class="heading"> Definitions of computer peripherals</p>


 
 <ul class="defnpoints">
   <li><dfn class="defn"><b> External or tangible devices which are attached to the external part of the computer</b> </li>
   <li> 	Any device connected internally or externally to a computer and used in the transfer of data. A personal computer or workstation processes information and, strictly speaking, that is all the computer does. Data (unprocessed information) must get into the computer, and the processed information must get out. Entering and displaying information is carried out on a wide variety of accessory devices called peripherals, also known as input/output (I/O) devices </b></dfn> 	 </li>
   <li> 	Any input, output or storage device connected externally or internally to the computer's CPU, such as a monitor, keyboard, printer, disk, tape, graphics tablet, scanner, joy stick, paddle or mouse. </li>
 
 </ul>
  <p class="heading"> Device driver </p>
 <p  class="note">It is a small program that tells the computer how to communicate with input/output (peripheral) devices. Every peripheral device needs device driver to communicate with the computer system.
 </p>
  <ul class="defnpoints">
   <li><b>	Computer peripherals were grouped into several categories:</b>  The Input Devices, The Output Devices, the Processors, The Storage Devices. </li>
   <li> <b>The Input device </b>- is a device that’s been used as a means of input.  It is any peripheral  (piece of computer hardware equipment) used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system such as a computer or other information appliance.  The common input devices are keyboard, mouse, scanner.  </li>
   <li> <b>Keyboard</b> - 	The computer key board is used to input, or enter, letters, numbers, symbols, punctuations and commands into the computer. The standard keyboard layout is sometimes called QWERTY layout and it is the most common layout.	</li>
    <img src="Keyboard.jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">

  
   
   <li><b>How keyboard works </b>-  The keys are arranged in rows and columns. When a key is pressed, a unique row-and-column signal is generated and sent to the keyboard interface IC on the keyboard. The keyboard interface then converts the row-and-column signal into single byte code called a Key code or scan code. When the key is released, a second signal is sent to the keyboard interface IC, which generates a break code. The keyboard interface IC then sends the scan codes by means of serial connection through the keyboard interface to the computer. The keyboard controller, located on the motherboard, converts the signals to parallel data and generates an interrupt so that the input can be serviced by the microprocessor. </li>
<li><b>	Mouse </b>– or a <b>pointing device</b> is any human interface device that allows a user to input spatial data to a computer. In the case of mice and touch screens, this is usually achieved by detecting movement across a physical surface. Analog devices, such as 3D mice,  joysticks, or pointing sticks, function by reporting their angle of deflection. Movements of the pointing device are echoed on the screen by movements of the cursor, creating a simple, intuitive way to navigate a computer's GUI.</li>

 <p class="heading"> Types of mouse</p>


  <p class="note"> <b>Opt mechanical mouse</b> -  The optical-mechanical or Opto-mechanical mouse consists of a ball that rolls one of two wheels inside the mouse. This wheel contains a circle of holes or notches that allow a LED light to be shined through and detected by a sensor, as each wheel spins they represent the X or Y axis for the mouse pointer. This mouse is much more accurate than the traditional mechanical mouse that used only wheels and rollers, however is not as good as an optical mouse.</p>
<p class="note"> Optical mouse - Computer mouse that utilizes light-emitting diodes (LED) or laser as a method of tracking movement. These mice are more proficient than other computer mice. These mice are easily identified by examining the bottom of the mouse. If the mouse has no ball or has a light emitting from the bottom it's most likely an optical mouse. This mouse is much more accurate than the ordinary optical mechanical mouse that relies on the traction between the mouse ball and the rollers. One drawback to an optical mouse is they can have problems in bright lights.</p>
  <p class="note">New Optical Mice no longer have the disadvantages of earlier mice and are capable of being utilized on any surface. In comparison to the traditional Optical-Mechanical mouse, the Optical is a much better solution for a computer mouse.	 </p>
 <li><b>Scanner</b> is a device that can scan or digitize images on paper and convert them to data that the computer can use. They can then be stored in a file, displayed on the screen, added to documents, or manipulated. <li>

	  <p class="note"> Input devices, such as buttons and joysticks, can be combined on a single physical device that could be thought of as a composite device. Many gaming devices have controllers like this. Technically mice are composite devices, as they both track movement and provide buttons for clicking, but composite devices are generally considered to have more than two different forms of input.</p>

</ul>
	    <p class="heading"> Imaging and Video input devices</p>
  <p class="note"> Video input devices are used to digitize images or video from the outside world into the computer. The information can be stored in a multitude of formats depending on the user's requirement.</p>

	<p class="heading"> Audio input devices </p>
	  <p class="note"> In the fashion of video devices, audio devices are used to either capture or create sound. In some cases, an audio output device can be used as an input device, in order to capture produced sound.</p>
	<ul class="defnpoints">

    <li> Microphone </li>
    <li> MIDI keyboard or other digital musical instrument </li>
</ul>
<p class="heading"> Output Device </p>

     <p class="note">An <b>output device</b> is any piece of computer hardware equipment used to communicate the results of data processing carried out by an information processing system (such as a computer) to the outside world.
In computing, input/output, or I/O, refers to the communication between an information processing system (such as a computer), and the outside world. Inputs are the signals or data sent to the system, and outputs are the signals or data sent by the system to the outside.
 </p>
<p class="heading"> Examples of output devices: </p>
   
<ul class="defnpoints">
    <li><b> Speakers</b>  </li>
	 <img src="speakers.jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
	 
	  <p class="note">Computer speakers range widely in quality and in price. The computer speakers typically packaged with computer systems are small, plastic, and have mediocre sound quality. Some computer speakers have equalization features such as bass and treble controls. </p>
	
    <li> <b>Headphones </b></li>
	<img src="Headphones.jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">

	
  <p class="note"> Headphones are a pair of small loudspeakers, or less commonly a single speaker, held close to a user's ears and connected to a signal source such as an audio amplifier, radio, CD player or portable media player. They are also known as stereo phones, headsets or, colloquially cans. The in-ear versions are known as ear phones or ear buds. In the context of telecommunication, the term headset is used to describe a combination of headphone and microphone used for two-way communication, for example with a telephone.</p>
    <li> <b>	Screen (Monitor) </b></li>	
	<img src="Monitor.jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
    <li>	A monitor or display (sometimes called a visual display unit) is an electronic visual display for computers. The monitor comprises the display device, circuitry, and an enclosure. The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) thin panel, while older monitors use a cathode ray tube about as deep as the screen size.  </li>
    <li>  	The first computer monitors used Cathode ray tubes (CRTs), which was the dominant technology until they were replaced by LCD monitors in the 21st Century.</li>
    <li>  Originally computer monitors were used for data processing while television receivers were used for entertainment. From the 80s onwards, computers have been used for both data processing and entertainment, while televisions have implemented some computer functionality. The common aspect ratio of televisions, and then computer monitors, has also changed from 4:3 to 16:9.</li>
   <li> <b>	Printer </b></li>
    <img src="Printer.jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
  <p class="note">In computing, a printer is a peripheral which produces a text and/or graphics of documents stored in electronic form, usually on physical print media such as paper or transparencies. Many printers are primarily used as local peripherals, and are attached by a printer cable or, in most newer printers, a USB cable to a computer which serves as a document source. Some printers, commonly known as network printers, have built-in network interfaces, typically wireless and/or Ethernet based, and can serve as a hard copy device for any user on the network. Individual printers are often designed to support both local and network connected users at the same time.   </p>

 <p class="note"> In addition, a few modern printers can directly interface to electronic media such as memory cards, or to image capture devices such as digital cameras, scanners; some printers are combined with a scanners and/or fax machines in a single unit, and can function as photocopiers. Printers that include non-printing features are sometimes called multifunction printers (MFP), multi-function devices (MFD), or all-in-one (AIO) printers. Most MFPs include printing, scanning, and copying among their many features.  </p>

 </ul> 
     <p class="heading"><b>The Processor </b></p>
	 <img src="Processors.jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
     <p class="note">The Processor or the central processing unit (CPU) is the portion of a computer system that carries out the instructions of a computer program, to perform the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of the system. The CPU plays a role somewhat analogous to the brain in the computer. The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s.  The form, design and implementation of CPUs have changed dramatically since the earliest examples, but their fundamental operation remains much the same. </p>
     <p class="note"> On large machines, CPUs require one or more printed circuit boards. On personal computers and small workstations, the CPU is housed in a single chip called a microprocessor. Since the 1970s the microprocessor class of CPUs has almost completely overtaken all other CPU implementations. Modern CPUs are large scale integrated circuits in small, rectangular packages, with multiple connecting pins.</p>
     <p class="note">Two typical components of a CPU are the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which performs arithmetic and logical operations, and the control unit (CU), which extracts instructions from memory and decodes and executes them, calling on the ALU when necessary.
<b>Example of Processors are: </b> Pentium 4, Core Duo, Dual Core, Core i3, Core i5, Corei7  
 </p>
 
 <p class="heading">   The Storage devices  </p>
  <p class="note"> Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, refers to  computer  components and recording media that retain digital data. Data storage is one of the core functions and fundamental components of computers.
There are 3 types of storage devices:</p>
   <ul class="steps">
    <li> Primary Storage – is also known as the main memory or a temporary storage device.  It is fast in nature but can accommodate only few data.  Data that has been stored in memory flushes off when you restart your computer, thus called temporary storage device.  
It is the only one directly accessible to the CPU. The CPU continuously reads instructions stored there and executes them as required. Any data actively operated on is also stored there in uniform manner. </li>
    <img src="ram.jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
    <li><b> Secondary Storage – Secondary storage </b>(also known as external memory or auxiliary storage), differs from primary storage in that it is not directly accessible by the CPU. The computer usually uses its input/output channels to access secondary storage and transfers the desired data using intermediate area in primary storage. Secondary storage does not lose the data when the device is powered down—it is non-volatile. Examples of a secondary storage device are Internal Hard drive, external Hard Drive, Flash Disk, CD/DVD, Floppy disk, Memory card. </li>
    <img src="harddisk .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
    
    
        <li> <b> Tertiary Storage -  Tertiary storage or tertiary memory</b>, provides a third level of storage. Typically it involves a robotic mechanism which will mount (insert) and dismount removable mass storage media into a storage device according to the system's demands; this data is often copied to secondary storage before use. It is primarily used for archiving rarely accessed information since it is much slower than secondary storage (e.g. 5–60 seconds vs. 1–10 milliseconds). This is primarily useful for extraordinarily large data stores, accessed without human operators. Typical examples include tape libraries and optical jukeboxes. </li>
        <img src="server .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
          <p class="note"> When a computer needs to read information from the tertiary storage, it will first consult a catalog database to determine which tape or disc contains the information. Next, the computer will instruct a robotic arm to fetch the medium and place it in a drive. When the computer has finished reading the information, the robotic arm will return the medium to its place in the library.</p>
    <li>  </li>
  </ul>
   <p class="heading"> Connectivity devices </p>
   
   <p class="note">The majority of external peripheral devices connect to the back of the computer’s system unit with cables. The computer’s system unit has a variety of ports available for use by different peripheral device cables. A port is a socket that is used to connect the cables from peripheral devices to the computer.</p>
      <p class="note"> Computer connectivity devices were grouped into several categories:</p>
   
      <p class="heading"> Ports</p>
           <img src="power .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
           <img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
   <p>There exist several types of ports like serial port, parallel port, USB port, AGP port, power supply port. </p>
   
   
		<p class="note"> As the name suggests, the serial port transfers data serially a bit at a time. As a result, the serial port needs only wire to transmit 8 bits. The disadvantage is that it takes 8 times longer to transmit a byte. Also, it is necessary to send a start bit before each byte of data, a stop bit after the byte to mark the end of byte and a parity bit to help check the integrity of data. Serial ports come in the form of 9-pin or 25-pin male connector. Serial ports are often known as communication ports or RS232C ports. They are typically used to connect devices like old mouse and modem.</p>
              <img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
   
   <p class="note">Parallel ports can send or receive a byte (8-bit) at a time. Unlike the serial port, these 8-bits are transmitted parallel to each other. Parallel ports come in the form of 25-pin female connector. Parallel ports are popularly used to connect printer, scanner, CD writer, zip drive, external hard disk drive, tape backup drive, etc. </p>
       <img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
   <p class="note"> To spare the user botheration of 8-pin, 25-pin, male, female connectors, the USB has been designed. It gives you a single, standardized, easy-to-use way to connect up to 127 devices to a computer. These devices include printers, scanners, mice, joystick, digital camera, web cameras, speakers, telephones, zip drives, network connections, scientific data acquisition devices, etc.</p>
          <img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
   <p class="note"> The AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) port is used to connect to graphic card that provides high-speed video performance typically required in games and other multimedia applications.</p>
             <img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
<p class="note"> Alternatively referred to as an Ethernet port, the LAN port is a port connection that allows a computer to connect to a network using a wired connection. In the picture to the right, is a close up example of what a LAN port looks like for a network cable using an RJ-45 connector. In the case of this example, the two led lights will blink when that port is active and receiving activity.</p>
          <img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
<p class="note">The PS/2 connector is a 6-pin Mini-DIN connector used for connecting some  keyboards  and mice to a PC compatible computer system. Its name comes from the IBM Personal System/2 series of personal computers, with which it was introduced in 1987. The PS/2 mouse connector generally replaced the older DE-9 RS-232 "serial mouse" connector, while the PS/2 keyboard connector replaced the larger 5-pin/180° DIN connector used in the IBM PC/AT design. The PS/2 designs on keyboard and mouse interfaces are electrically similar and employ the same communication protocol. However, a given system's keyboard and mouse port may not be interchangeable since the two devices use a different set of commands. Today this connector has all but been replaced by USB </p>
<img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
<p class="note">A power supply is a device that supplies electrical energy to one or more electric loads. The term is most commonly applied to devices that convert one form of electrical energy to another, though it may also refer to devices that convert another form of energy (e.g., mechanical, chemical, solar) to electrical energy. A regulated power supply is one that controls the output voltage or current to a specific value; the controlled value is held nearly constant despite variations in either load current or the voltage supplied by the power supply's energy source.
Every power supply must obtain the energy it supplies to its load, as well as any energy it consumes while performing that task, from an energy source.  </p>
 <img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
 <p class="note"> A Video Graphics Array (VGA) connector is a three-row 15-pin DE-15 connector. The 15-pin VGA connector is found on many video cards, computer monitors, and some high definition televisionsets. On laptop computers or other small devices, a mini-VGA port is sometimes used in place of the full-sized VGA connector.
Terminals
A computer terminal is an electronic or electromechanical hardware device that is used for entering data into, and displaying data from, a computer or a computing system. </p>
  <img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
 <p class="note"> The function of a terminal is confined to display and input of data; a device with significant local programmable data processing capability may be called a "smart terminal" or fat client. A terminal that depends on the host computer for its processing power is called a dumb terminal or thin client. A personal computer can run software that emulates the function of a terminal, sometimes allowing concurrent use of local programs and access to a distant terminal host system.</p>
    <p class="heading"> Types of text terminals</p>
 <p class="note"> The System console is a text terminal used to operate a computer. Modern computers have a built-in keyboard and display for the console. Some Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X have virtual consoles to provide several text terminals on a single computer. </p>
   <img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
 <p class="note">A terminal emulator is a computer program in a graphical windowing system that lets the user operate a text terminal in a window. This lets applications for text terminals run under a modern  graphical user interface. Popular terminal emulators include xterm and rxvt. </p>

   <p class="heading"> Connectors </p>
   <p class="note"> CAT5 NETWORK CABLE - This cable allows the computer to communicate    to      other computers over a network. It also provides networked computers access to the Internet</p>
      <img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p class="note"> MONITOR CABLE - This cable is usually permanently connected to a monitor. Small screws hold the cable in place</p>
           <img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
             <p class="note"> USB CABLE - Most PC's now have these fast and versatile ports on the front and back. They can be used for portable storage devices, digital cameras, scanners, video cameras, printers, keyboards and mice - just about everything!</p>
                <img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
                  <p class="note"> POWER CORD - This is a standard "kettle cord" that connects the computer to the AC outlet on the wall and the power supply of the computer. This MUST be unplugged if you are ever doing any maintenance work inside the computer.  </p>
                     <img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
                       <p class="note"> PRINTER CABLE - This is a 25-pin "D" shaped connector that connect printers to the parallel port on a computer. (Newer printers may connect with a USB plug.)</p>
                          <img src="port .jpg" alt="Arrays" width="100%" height="100%">
