it’s important to know exactly what employers look for when hiring
full-time employees. In addition to relevant skills, employers seek
employees who have the personal values, characteristics, and
personality traits that spell success. Good personal values are what
makes the foundation for a good employee. Internships are an
excellent time to show employers that you have the personal traits
that they value in their employees. Do not make the mistake of
missing the opportunity to show your supervisors at your internship
that you have what it takes to be successful on the job as well as
possessing the personal characteristics they value. An internship is
an opportunity to learn the skills and behaviors along with the work
values that are required for success in the workplace.</font></font></p>

<font face="Verdana, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Employers
value employees who understand and possess a willingness to work
hard. In addition to working hard it is also important to work smart.
This means learning the most efficient way to complete tasks and
finding ways to save time while completing daily assignments. It’s
also important to care about your job and complete all projects while
maintaining a positive attitude. Doing more than is expected on the
job is a good way to show management that you utilize good time
management skills and don’t waste valuable company time attending
to personal issues not related to the job. Downsizing in today’s
job market is quite common so it’s important to recognize the
personal values and attributes employers want to improve your chances
of job security should a layoff occur.</font></font></p>

<font face="Verdana, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Employers
value employees who come to work on time, are there when they are
suppose to be, and are responsible for their actions and behavior.
It’s important to keep supervisors abreast of changes in your
schedule or if you are going to be late for any reason. This also
means keeping your supervisor informed on where you are on all
projects you have been assigned. Being dependable and responsible as
an employee shows your employer that you value your job and that you
are responsible in keeping up with projects and keeping them informed
of the things that they should know about.</font></font></p>

<font face="Verdana, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Employers
seek employees who take the initiative and have the motivation to get
the job done in a reasonable period of time. A positive attitude gets
the work done and motivates others to do the same without dwelling on
the challenges that inevitably come up in any job. It is the
enthusiastic employee who creates an environment of good will and who
provides a postive role model for others. A positive attitude is
something that is most valued by supervisors and co-workers and that
also makes the job more pleasant and fun to go to each day.</font></font></p>

<font face="Verdana, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Employers
seek employees who are adaptable and maintain flexibility in
completing tasks in an ever changing workplace. Being open to change
and improvements provides an opportunity to complete work assignments
in a more efficient manner while offering additional benefits to the
corporation, the customer, and even the employee. While oftentimes
employees complain that changes in the workplace don’t make sense
or makes their work harder, oftentimes these complaints are due to a
lack of flexibility.</font></font></p>

<font face="Verdana, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Adaptability
also means adapting to the personality and work habits of co-workers
and supervisors. Each person possesses their own set or strengths and
adapting personal behaviors to accommodate others is part of what it
takes to work effectively as a team. By viewing change as an
opportunity to complete work assignments in a more efficient manner,
adapting to change can be a positive experience. New strategies,
ideas, priorities, and work habits can foster a belief among workers
that management and staff are both committed to making the workplace
a better place to work.</font></font></p>

<font face="Verdana, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Employers
value employees who maintain a sense of honesty and integrity above
all else. Good relationships are built on trust. When working for an
employer they want to know that they can trust what you say and what
you do. Successful businesses work to gain the trust of customers and
maintain the attitude that “the customer is always right”. It is
the responsibility of each person to use their own individual sense
of moral and ethical behavior when working with and serving others
within the scope of their job.</font></font></p>

<font face="Verdana, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Employers
look for employees who require little supervision and direction to
get the work done in a timely and professional manner. Supervisors
who hire self-motivated employees do themselves an immense favor. For
self-motivated employees require very little direction from their
supervisors. Once a self-motivated employee understands his/her
responsibility on the job, they will do it without any prodding from
others. Employers can do their part by offering a safe, supportive,
work environment that offers employees an opportunity to learn and
grow. Working in a supportive work environment and taking the
intiative to be self-directive will provide employees with a better
sense of accomplishment and increased self-esteem.</font></font></p>

an ever-changing workplace, employers seek employees who are
interested in keeping up with new developments and knowledge in the
field. It has been noted that one of the top reasons employees leave
their employers is the lack of opportunity for career development
within the organization. Learning new skills, techniques, methods,
and/or theories through professional development helps keep the
organization at the top of its field and makes the employee's job
more interesting and exciting. Keeping up with current changes in the
field is vital for success and increased job security.</font></font></p>

<font face="Verdana, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Self-confidence
has been recognized as the key ingredient between someone who is
successful and someone who is not. A self – confident person is
someone who inspires others. A self-confident person is not afraid to
ask questions on topics where they feel they need more knowledge.
They feel little need to have to impress others with what they know
since they feel comfortable with themselves and don’t feel they
need to know everything.</font></font></p>

themselves and their abilities which is manifested in their positive

<font face="Verdana, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Employers
value employees who exhibit professional behavior at all times.
Professional behavior includes learning every aspect of a job and
doing it to the best of one’s ability. Professionals look, speak,
and dress accordingly to maintain an image of someone who takes pride
in their behavior and appearance. Professionals complete projects as
soon as possible and avoid letting uncompleted projects pile up.
Professionals complete high quality work and are detail oriented.
Professional behavior includes all of the behavior above in addition
to providing a positive role model for others. Professionals are
enthusiastic about their work and optimistic about the organization
and its future. To become a professional you must feel like a
professional and following these tips is a great start to getting to
where you want to go.</font></font></p>

<font face="Verdana, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Employers
value employees they can trust and who exhibit their loyalty to the
company. Loyalty in the workforce has taken on a new meaning. Gone
are the days when employees plan on starting out and retiring with
the same company. It is said that most people will hold between 8 –
12 jobs throughout their career. What does this mean in terms of
loyalty in today’s workforce?</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.25in; line-height: 0.19in; background: #ffffff">
<font face="Verdana, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Companies
offering employee growth and opportunity will ultimately gain a sense
of loyalty from their employees. Employees today want to feel a sense
of satisfaction in their jobs and will do a good job when they feel
that the employer is fair and wants to see them succeed. Although
this may mean only staying for five or ten years in a position,
employees can offer loyalty and make an important contribution during
their time with the company.</font></font></p>

<font face="Verdana, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">More
companies today encourage employee feedback and offer employees an
opportunity to lead in their area of expertise. This gives employees
a greater sense of satisfaction and a sense of control over their
job. Empowerment encourages employees to do their best work since
companies are displaying a trust and expectation that they believe in
their employees to do a good job.</font></font></p>

jobs that encourage learning and the development of new skills also
gives employees a sense of empowerment in the workplace. Aligning an
employees values with the goals of the organization will foster
loyalty and a bond between employer and employee. Fostering good
relationships within an organization and offering constructive ways
to handle conflict provides a win – win situation for both employer
and employee. Creating an organization that values loyalty within the
organization can also work to its benefit by using the same
techniques and strategies to establish loyalty with customers; and
loyatly from customers ultimately makes for a successful business.</font></font></p>
