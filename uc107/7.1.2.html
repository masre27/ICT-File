     <p class="note"> Small projects don’t necessarily require much knowledge of project management or much project management discipline. But as a project gets larger, formal processes and techniques become essential. Different project management methodologies organize and structure these processes in various ways, but we’re going to focus on 10 basic areas: </p>



   <ul class="steps">
    <li> Define the project </li>
    <li>Plan the work </li>
    <li> Manage the work plan </li>
    <li> Manage issues</li>
    <li> Manage scope</li>
    <li> Manage risks   </li>
    <li>  Manage communication  </li>
    <li>  Manage documentation  </li>
    <li> Manage quality   </li>
    <li> Manage metrics   </li>
   </ul>

	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial, serif"><b>Define
	the project</b></font></p>
</ol>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif">As the project manager, you must make sure
that the work is properly understood and agreed to by the project
sponsor and key stakeholders before the project work begins. You’ll
work with the sponsor and stakeholders to ensure that the project
team and the client have common perceptions of what the project will
deliver, when it will be complete, what it will cost, who will do the
work, how the work will be completed, and what the benefits will be.</font></p>
<ol start="2">
	<li><p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Arial, serif"><b>Plan the work</b></font></p>
</ol>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif">In this stage, you determine how the work
will be completed. This involves building the Project Work plan.
You’ll take different approaches according to the size of the
project. For example, the work plan for small projects can be built
using a project management package like Microsoft Project, a </font>

<ol start="3">
	<li><p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Arial, serif"><b>Manage the work plan</b></font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif">At this point, you’ve finished defining
the project and planning the work. The major deliverables in place
are the Project Definition and Project Work plan. You’ll never be a
successful project manager if you don’t keep the work plan up to
date. Remember, the work plan is only a deliverable. It describes the
work that needs to occur, the order of the work, how much effort is
required, and who is assigned, but it represents only your best guess
as to how to complete the remaining work at any particular point in
the project.</font></p>
<ol start="4">
	<li><p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Arial, serif"><b>Manage issues</b></font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif">An “issue” arises when a problem will
hinder the progress of the project and can’t be resolved by the
project manager and project team without outside help. If a major
problem emerges, you have no choice but to resolve it. The only
question is whether you’ll actively apply issues management to the
situation or struggle through uncertainty about how the issue should
be resolved.</font></p>
<ol start="5">
	<li><p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Arial, serif"><b>Manage scope</b></font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif">Scope describes the boundaries of the
project and defines what the project will deliver, what data is
needed, and which organizations are affected. Given a set of
resources and time, an infinite number of things can be delivered.</font></p>
<ol start="6">
	<li><p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Arial, serif"><b>Manage risk</b></font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif">Risk refers to future conditions or
circumstances that exist outside the control of the project team and
that will have an adverse impact on the project if they occur. In
other words, whereas an issue is a current problem that must be dealt
with, a risk is a potential problem. Reactive project managers
resolve issues when they arise. Proactive project managers</font><font face="Arial, serif"><i>
</i></font><font face="Arial, serif">try to identify and resolve
potential problems before they occur. This is the science and art of
risk management.</font></p>
<ol start="7">
	<li><p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Arial, serif"><b>Manage communication</b></font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif">Properly communicating on a project is
critical for managing the clients and the shareholders. If they’re
not kept well informed of the project progress, there is a much
greater chance of problems and difficulties due to differing
expectation levels. </font>
</p>
<ol start="8">
	<li><p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Arial, serif"><b>Manage documents</b></font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif">Project managers on smaller projects don’t
need to give as much thought to managing documentation. As projects
get larger, the documentation definitively needs to be actively
managed. Problems at their simplest include documentation that gets
lost or is hard to find and work that ends up being duplicated. At
its worst, document versions get out of order, document updates get
over-posted and lost, and confusion and uncertainty reign.</font></p>
<ol start="9">
	<li><p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Arial, serif"><b>Manage quality</b></font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif">Quality is represented by how close the
project and deliverables come to meeting the client’s requirements
and expectations. In other words, quality is ultimately measured by
the client.</font></p>
<ol start="10">
	<li><p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
	<font face="Arial, serif"><b>Manage metrics</b></font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Gathering
metrics on a project is the most sophisticated project management
process and can be the hardest. Because metrics can be difficult to
define and collect, they’re usually ignored or handled poorly. All
projects should be gathering basic metric information regarding cost,
effort, and cycle time. </font></font>
