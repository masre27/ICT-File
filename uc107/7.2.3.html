<font face="Arial, serif">When confronted with a systems failure,
there is often a natural tendency to begin disassembling hardware to
search for the cause.  This is a poor approach.  Failed hardware can
expose precious information and safeguards are necessary to prevent
losing that information from careless remove procedures.  One must
know what to look for prior to disassembling failed hardware.  </font>

<font face="Arial, serif">Faults that come and go are the worst ones
to track down, since just when you think you know the cause of the
problem and intend to do something about it can disappear, leaving
you wondering whether or not it's cured.</font> 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif">The most serious random problem is a
spontaneous reboot, which can be caused by a faulty, bad mains
interference, or overheating, particularly of the CPU. This is often
caused by failure of the CPU fan, but this is easy enough to check --
just open up the case and see if the fan is still spinning. If your
cooling arrangements are not broken but simply insufficient (this can
happen, particularly in the case of Athlon processors, which generate
a lot of heat), you'll need to upgrade your CPU heatsink and/or fan
to bring its top temperature down to a more sensible level. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif">However, your computer is most likely to go
wrong when you've just changed something, for instance when you've
installed a new stick of RAM, a soundcard, hard drive, or a new CPU.
Even though this may work perfectly well, you may have disturbed one
of the cables inside your PC at the same time, giving you a
completely unrelated problem; or if you've been overclocking your
CPU, it may stop working when a new PCI card is installed.</font></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif">If your PC won't boot up, no LEDs
illuminate on the PC's front panel, and you can't hear your hard
drives or cooling fans spin up, you may have a problem with your
mains supply, or a faulty or dead computer PSU (Power Supply Unit).
Faulty power supplies can also cause random reboots: these can also
mean that your power supply is working properly but is under such a
heavy load that occasionally the voltages sag a bit, or even
collapse. </font>

<font face="Arial, serif"><b>BIOS Beep Codes</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif">If the power supply is working, booting
your PC will light the front panel-power LED and let the BIOS perform
a Power-On Self-Test, or POST. This initializes system hardware;
tests RAM the keyboard, serial and parallel ports, initialize the
floppy drive and hard disk controller, and diagnose any basic
problems. If none are found, you'll get one short beep from the
internal PC speaker. A combination of long or short beeps signifies a
problem, and in most cases your PC will refuse to carry on. Although
many 'beep codes' are similar from motherboard to motherboard, you
really need to refer to the manual to find out what each sequence of
beeps signifies.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif"><b>Cable Issues</b></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif">Another source of sometimes weird hardware
faults is internal cabling. For instance, if the IDE cable connecting
your motherboard and hard drive is not inserted correctly, your drive
may not be detected by the BIOS at all. One of the conductors on all
IDE cables will either be colored red or have writing printing on it,
so make sure these identification marks match up with pin one on your
hard drive, and pin one on the motherboard socket. </font>

<font face="Arial, serif"><b>Summary on How to Fix and Avoid General
Protection Faults</b></font><font face="Arial, serif"><br/>
If you
usually get a general protection fault when your computer has been
running for a certain length of time, then overheating is a likely
cause. You may have to reduce the level of over clocking or replace a
fan that isn't working. When the problem occurs after the addition of
new memory, remove or replace it to see if this cures the problem. If
you can't do any of this yourself, get an engineer to do it for you.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">When
the fault always occurs soon after turning on your computer, it may
be caused by a driver used by one of the programs that loads at start
up or by Windows itself. You can try a Windows install but choose the
repair option, which will fix corrupt or missing files without losing
your data or programs.<br/>
If the fault always happens when a
particular program is running, uninstall and then re-install it.
Also, check the supplier's website for a later version of the program
or drivers and install them.<br/>
Actually finding the cause of the
general protection fault can be a time-consuming process and you can
speed this up by using a tool that will automate the task. One of the
best I've found for this is Registry Patrol, which, despite its name,
does much more than just sort out the PC's registry. It will, in
fact, undertake a deep scan of the whole computer, sorting out all
the drivers and DLLs that are the most likely cause of general
protection faults. As a bonus, it will also fix all types of other
problems so that you end up with a machine that starts quicker, runs
better and is less likely to crash.<br/>
Registry Patrol comes with a
guarantee that it will do what it promises and is available to try as
a free download from the company's website (www.registrypatrol.com).
Once you've installed it and run the scan, your PC will run as it did
when it was new and general protection faults will be a thing of the
past.</span></font></font></p>
