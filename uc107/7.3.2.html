<p class="heading"> QUALITY AT WORK</p>


<p> "Do to others as you would have them do to you" </p>
<p> Have you realized the importance of Quality in your daily life.  </p>
<p> Imagine the scooter/car you bought yesterday refuses to start today. </p>


   <p class="note">In every situation you must have chosen the "quality" brand with faith. You choose quality in every walk of your life. Without Quality in each service you are receiving everyday you feel miserable. We demand quality. Quality is important for YOU. So is for EVERYONE. When we demand quality we have the duty to deliver quality also. As a member of society continuously motivated for a "QUALITY" life we also do our part unconsciously. Imagine the satisfaction you gain by giving proper directions to a lost person. You have given a quality service. We derive tremendous satisfaction out of doing a good turn or quality work at any moment. Greater will be our satisfaction if we extend this "Quality" aspect into each moment of our life.  </p>
   <p class="heading">Quality is more important than we realize. Quality makes life what it is.</p>   
  
   <p class="note">We as professionals in software are responsible for the quality of our products. Imagine yourself typing a 5 page document and the application crashes without saving your work. Imagine as a data entry operator after entering 50 fields losing the data by pressing a wrong key. What it does to you? The faith placed in the product is shaken and you will be pretty scared to repeat the job despite many reassurances. Faith once lost cannot be regained. As a software developer it may be a mere bug to you. But to the user it is more than that. The quality of software depends on putting quality at each stage of software development cycle.  </p>
   <p class="note"> Quality is not someone’s responsibility. It is everyone’s responsibility. A wrongly connected transistor in 250 W music system can make it DUMB. A loosely fitted nut in a scooter can smash the scooter. Quality at every stage of product development is essential for delivering a Quality Product. </p>
   <p class="heading"> Think Quality, Write Quality Code, deliver Quality product.</p>
   <p class="note">Quality belongs to none. Quality cannot be qualified or quantified. You have done some work. There will always be a better way to do it. Quality is the BEST you can do. Imagine a painter - he is never satisfied with his work. Every time he looks at the painting he will feel like adding one line here and another there. He ponders, He wonders, He beautifies his creation. If we at our professional arts of conceptualization, design, coding, testing look at our work with such an artistic eye Quality will be come naturally into our products. Continuous improvement, zeal for perfection are needed to build QUALITY AT WORK. TOGETHER we can MAKE it.  </p>
