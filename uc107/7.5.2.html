<p class="heading">	Production process 	 </p>


    <p class="note"> The production process is concerned with transforming a range of inputs into those outputs that are required by the market.  </p>
    <p class="note"> The transforming resources include the buildings, machinery, computers, and people that carry out the transforming processes. The transformed resources are the raw materials and components that are transformed into end products.  </p>
    <p class="note">Any production process involves a series of links in a production chain. At each stage value is added in the course of production. Adding value involves making a product more desirable to a consumer so that they will pay more for it. Adding value therefore is not just about manufacturing, but includes the marketing process including advertising, promotion and distribution that make the final product more desirable.   </p>
    <p class="note">It is very important for businesses to identify the processes that add value, so that they can enhance these processes to the ongoing benefit of the business.   </p>
    <p class="heading"> Types of process	</p>
    <p>There are three main types of process: job, batch and flow production. </p>
    
    
    <p class="heading">	Job production	 </p>

        <p class="note"> Job or \'make complete\' production is the creation of single items by either one operative or a team of operative\'s. Job production is unique in the fact that the project is considered to be a single operation, which requires the complete attention of the operative before he or she passes on to the next job. Examples from the service industries include cutting hair, and processing a customers\' order in a store. </p>
         <p class="heading" Batch production	 </p>

        <p class="note">The term batch refers to a specific group of components, which go through a production process together. As one batch finishes, the next one starts. For example on Monday, Machine A produces a type 1 engine part, on Tuesday it produces a type 2 engine part, on Wednesday a type 3 and so on. All engine parts will then go forward to the final assembly of different categories of engine parts.  </p>
              <p class="heading" Batch production	 </p>      
      <p class="note"> Batch production is described as \'intermittent\' production and is characterized by irregularity. If the rest period in batch production disappeared it would then become flow production. Flow production is therefore a continuous process of parts and sub-assemblies passing on from one stage to another until completion. </p>
