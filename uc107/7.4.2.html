<p class="heading">Workplace Prevention and Response  </p>
   <ul class="steps">
    <li><p class="heading"> Workplace Violence</p> 
     <p class="note"> Workplace violence can be any act of physical violence, threats of physical violence, harassment, pressure, or other threatening, disruptive behavior that occurs at the work site. Workplace violence can affect or involve employees, visitors, contractors, and other non-Federal employees. </p>
    </li>
    <li> <p class="heading">Responsibilities  </p>
        <p class="note">It is up to each employee to help make a safe workplace for all of us. The expectation is that each employee will treat all other employees, as well as customers and potential customers, with dignity and respect. You can and should expect management to care about your safety and to provide as safe a working environment as possible by having preventive measures in place and, if necessary, by dealing immediately with threatening or potentially violent situations which occur.  </p>
    </li>
    <li> <p class="heading">Prevention of Workplace Violence </p>
        <p class="note"> A sound prevention plan is the most important and, in the long run, the least costly portion of any agency’s workplace violence program.  </p>
    </li>
    <li> 
    <p class="heading">Identifying Potentially Violent Situations </p>
        <p class="note">If you ever have concerns about a situation which may turn violent, alert your supervisor immediately and follow the specific reporting procedures provided by your agency. It is better to err on the side of safety than to risk having a situation escalate.  </p>
    </li>
    
    <li> 
    <p class="heading"> Responding to Violent Incidents </p>
    
    <p class="note">No matter how effective agencies' policies and plans are in detecting and preventing incidents, there are no guarantees against workplace violence. Even the most responsive employers face this issue. When a violent incident does occur, it is essential the response be timely, appropriate to the situation, and carried out with the recognition that employees are traumatized and that the incident’s aftermath has just begun.  </p>
    </li>
    <li> 
    <p class="heading">Disclosure of Information  </p>
        <p class="note"> Disclosing information obtained from employees without their written consent. An exception to this prohibition however, is if an employee specifically threatens another person.  </p>
    </li>
   </ul>
