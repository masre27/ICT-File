<p class="heading">	Quality Performance in Production Management	 </p>

    <p class="note">The challenge is increasing production while maintaining high quality. This process can be difficult to measure, but best way to gauge quality is to first measure it. Use key performance indicators (KPIs) to improve quality. KPIs help management to manage and measure both production and quality. Financial analysts and mangers also use KPIs as a measure of productivity.  </p>
    <p class="head"> 	Instructions	</p>
    <ul class="defnpoints">
    <li>Identify the three most important processes in production. Examples include inventory purchases, assembly, distribution and accounts payable. </li>
    <li>Map out each process on a flow chart diagram. Start with first step in each process and end with the last step. This helps all parties involved in the process to visualize the process as well as where possible errors in production may occur. </li>
    <li> Identify the best way to manage production for each process. For instance, assembly can be managed with the number of items produced and distribution can be managed by the total number of items delivered.</li>
    <li> Define what an error or issue is within the process. For instance, for assembly, measure the number of errors or mistakes by determining how many of the total device being produced did not work or were permanent. For distribution, you could determine the number of errors by monitoring on-time delivery. The error depends on the process and your firm's definition of quality.</li>
    <li> Assign a quality metric to each production process. Combine Step 3 and 4. For instance, for assembly, one metric can be the number of products assembled incorrectly or the number of malfunctions. For distribution, the metric can be the number of on-time deliveries. Again, the metric depends on what's most important for your organization.</li>
