<p class="heading"> 1. Overview </p>



     <p class="note"> Technological advances have made computers an important part of every workplace. Many companies store valuable data on computer systems, databases and networks, and most workplace communication is done using computers and networks. Although computers allow businesses to streamline processes, distribute information quickly and stay competitive, it also allows the potential for security issues that can ultimately affect business operations and integrity. </p>
    <p class="heading"> Benefits </p>

     <p class="note">Because most data is stored on computers and almost all communication is done on an organization's computer network, the security of the data is crucial for the success of an organization. Monitoring workplace computers can be done using a variety of software products that monitor computer networks. This software can also be used to monitor or track employee activity and productivity as well. This ensures data is secure by using the software to block certain websites, alert information technology staff of potential threats, such as computer viruses, as well as monitor computer and Internet usage by employees.  </p>
       <p class="heading"> Effects </p>

     <p class="note"> Monitoring workplace computers can secure data stored on computer systems, as well as ensure employees are using workplace computers for business purposes. Some monitoring software comes highly recommended at a reasonable cost and can be customized to an organization's needs. This requires some additional efforts by management or information technology staff, but proves it's a valuable tool to ensure the security of business data and integrity. Although computer workplace monitoring has become a necessity, employees often don't understand the reasons for computer monitoring and may feel violated or micro-managed. </p>
            <p class="heading"> Considerations </p>
     <p class="note">When considering using computer monitoring software in the workplace, do extensive research on different products and services. Although some software is costly, it may be worth the investment to protect the integrity of a business. If an organization decides to use this software--inform employees. Allow employees to see the software and its capabilities by demonstrating its features in a group setting. Be open and honest regarding how the software will be used and how it will add security to the business. Talk to employees about their rights regarding computer monitoring. The Texas Workforce Commission has policies for workplace computer monitoring and employees should be aware of those policies. Also allow employees to ask questions in a private setting if they wish.  </p>
