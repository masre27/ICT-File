Policies and Procedures</p>

     <p class="note"> Every organization has particular ways of doing things. An important part of being to learn how the workplace functions. Policies and procedures are ‘rules’ that provide guidelines as to what is expected and accepted in the workplace. Policies and procedures are put in place for many different reasons and can relate to different aspects of the organization, such as  </p>


<ul class="defnpoints">
    <li>customer service,  </li>
    <li>profitability,  </li>
    <li>quality assurance, ethics,  </li>
    <li>resources,  </li>
    <li>business and performance plans,  </li>
    <li>sales targets,  </li>
    <li>productivity,  </li>
    <li>marketing,  </li>
    <li> staff and customer safety,</li>
    <li> legal requirements and government regulations.</li>
</ul>


     <p class="note"> The reasons behind such guidelines should be understood. Policies and procedures help employees by explaining exactly what is required in particular situations. Some organizations do not have formal policies and procedures in place. Instead, employees learn what is expected of them by observing others and obtaining guidance and feedback from supervisors and others. </p>
