<p class="heading">4. Receiving workplace Instructions </p>



     <p class="note">When you are receiving instructions from someone else, especially if they are speaking to you: </p>

<ul class="defnpoints">
    <li>stop whatever else you are doing </li>
    <li>focus on the person speaking </li>
    <li>if you can, make notes about the details </li>
    <li>when the person has finished, tell them what you understood from their instructions to make sure you have understood them correctly the instructions were not heard correctly due to: </li>
    <li>too much noise around – ask to move to a quieter place </li>
    <li>the person not speaking loudly or clearly enough – ask them to speak up  </li>
    <li>not enough detail was given: </li>
    <li> ask for more information – don’t assume you know what they mean </li>
    <li>the meaning was unclear: </li>
    <li>check the outcome and the purpose of the task </li>
    <li>Repeat back what you have heard and understood to check that it is correct.   </li>
</ul>


<p class="heading"> Written Instructions and notice </p>
<p>The following points should help you to follow written instructions in a more effective way.</p>


<ul class="defnpoints">
    <li>Read through all the instructions or steps before beginning the task. This will give a clear picture of what the whole tasks involves </li>
    <li>If diagrams are provided take the time to look at them carefully. As you work through the task check the diagrams to make sure that your work matches the example given. </li>
    <li>If you are not sure of the meaning of any words or terms take the time to find out the correct meaning. Ask your workplace supervisor if you guess correctly you may find that you cannot complete the task or that the finished task is not done properly. </li>
    <li>Avoid the temptation to try to complete the task before reading all the instructions. Although the job may take a little longer, it will save time in the long run as you may avoid mistakes. </li>
</ul>
